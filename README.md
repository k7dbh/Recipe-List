## 🍽️ App Description:

Recipe-List is a web app that allows users to browse, add, edit, and delete recipes. Users can create an account, log in, and save their favorite recipes. The app lets you easily organize and discover new dishes, making it simple to manage your personal collection of recipes.

## 🔎 Background info:
I am building this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp.

I chose to create a Recipe-List app because I find cooking and recipe sharing both fun and useful. This project is a great way for me to practice JavaScript fundamentals, work with CSS Grid for modern layouts, and deepen my understanding of web development with technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I believe this knowledge will be valuable for my future as a developer.
